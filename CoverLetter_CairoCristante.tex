% Opening remarks and expression of interest for the role 
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Engineering and Applied Science Trainee program at Ontario Power Generation. Upon completing my 16-month Professional Engineering Year Internship in August 2025, I am eager to continue my professional development with OPG.

% Paragraph describing why I want to work for the company/role
This trainee position directly supports my career objectives by providing the hands-on experience and engineering training necessary to obtain my Professional Engineering License (P.Eng). My passion for nuclear technology, particularly in design and new nuclear applications, aligns with my long-term goal of contributing to new nuclear station design. Throughout my internship, I have been impressed by OPG's unwavering commitment to safety, excellence, and maintaining the highest industry standards, values I consider essential in plant engineering.

% Paragraph describing why I am a good fit for the role
As a current PEY student with Darlington Chemistry Laboratory and Chemistry Technical, I have developed comprehensive understanding of the knowledge and skills required for Central Chemistry team operations. My involvement in migrating to a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), collaborating with Central Chemistry, Darlington, and Pickering Chemistry departments, has strengthened my grasp of governing chemistry principles and best practices required to deliver functional solutions. Additionally, my laboratory support work has provided me with thorough understanding of analytical techniques and chemical monitoring practices, enabling me to operate effectively within the Central Chemistry team's broader scope.

My experience on the LIMS project and laboratory work has provided valuable chemistry insights and exposure to diverse plant systems typically inaccessible in other company positionsâ€”from primary and secondary systems used in power generation to specialized auxiliary systems supporting plant operations. This comprehensive systems knowledge, combined with my chemistry control expertise, offers a unique perspective for design requirements in new nuclear and plant design applications.

% Closing Remarks
Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and official transcript for your reference. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you further about how I can contribute to the on going success OPG's industry leading engineering as a part of the Engineering and Applied Science Trainee role. Please feel free to contact me via email at \href{mailto:cairo.cristante@gmail.com}{cairo.cristante@gmail.com} or call via +1(647)-968-8060.
