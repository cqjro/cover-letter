% Opening remarks and expression of interest for the role 
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Engineering and Applied Science Trainee program at Ontario Power Generation. Throughout my 16-month Profressional Engineering Year Internship in the Darlington Chemistry department, I have been impressed by OPG's unwavering commitment to safety, excellence, and maintaining the highest industry standards. I find these values to be personally crucial in the workplace, which is why I wish to continue my professional journey with OPG.

% Upon completing my 16-month Professional Engineering Year Internship in August 2025, I am eager to continue my professional development with OPG.

% Paragraph describing why I want to work for the company/role

My intended long-term career goals are to attain my Progessional Engineering Licence (P.Eng), and contribute to the design of new nuclear systems. After consulting with a current Central Chemistry Trainee, I understand this role provides the engineering support training and experience essential for achieving my P.Eng. My passion for nuclear technology, particularly in design, chemistry, and new nuclear applications, directly aligns with the available positions within this program.

% Paragraph describing why I am a good fit for the role
As a part of my internship at OPG with Darlington Chemistry, I have gained ample familiarity with governing chemistry principles and practices which maintain and protect system health. With this knowledge I developed station-wide laboratory result reporting tools and advocated for the repair of critical online instrumentation, which has increased visability of chemical events and chemical monitoring capabilites. Addtionally, I facilitated updates Chemistry Laboratory procedures and governance documents to ensure adequate standards are maintained and adhered to. As a Trainee, I would continue to push for this high standard of excellence by advocating for station longevity, safety, and performace.

In addtion, my work with Chemistry Laboratory in the station, as well as Pickering and Central Chemistry groups, has allowed me to gain exporsure to a wide range of station systems as well as understanding of station work group activities. My exposure will allow me to provide unique chemistry insight in design roles and deeper understanding of station behaviour in governance roles.

% As a current PEY student with Darlington Chemistry Laboratory and Chemistry Technical, I have developed comprehensive understanding of the knowledge and skills required for Central Chemistry team operations. My involvement in migrating to a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), collaborating with Central Chemistry, has strengthened my grasp of governing chemistry principles and best practices to maintain system health. Additionally, my laboratory support work has provided me with thorough understanding of analytical techniques and chemical monitoring practices, enabling me to operate effectively within the Central Chemistry team's broader scope.

 % My experience working with both Chemistry Technical and Labtoratory teams provided exposure to diverse plant systems typically inaccessible in other company positions—from primary and secondary systems used in power generation to specialized auxiliary systems supporting plant operations. This comprehensive systems knowledge and my chemistry control expertise, allows me to offer a unique perspective for design in new nuclear and plant design applications.



% Closing Remarks
Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and official transcript for your reference. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you further about how I can contribute to the on going success OPG's industry leading engineering as a part of the Engineering and Applied Science Trainee role.
